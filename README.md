Implementation of interpretable models for data science competitions. Each model/idea gets its own folder.

A running list of implementations and references:

- **generalized additive model (GAM):**

https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/07/30/gam/

- **transfer entropy:**

causal relationship between two time series, no assumptions about linearity (Kraskov mutual information estimator)

- **kPC algorithm:**

find DAG's, graphs of causal relationships

R implementation: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kpcalg/index.html

- **kNN imputation of missing values:**

not a "model", but probably will be helpful.

- **dynamic time warping:**

comparing time series at different speeds, spreads. fastDTW implementation in python.

- **arima model:**

Forecasting on time series data

- **some pretty geographic plot setup: (geo)**

heatmaps, clustering, etc. 

See as example: https://github.com/spmuppar/The-Data-Open-Citadel/blob/master/team_6_submission.pdf, figure 2.
